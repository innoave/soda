Soda for Scala is a like soda for drinks. It provides a set of (small) individual libs that speed up development of reald world applications in Scala.

## About

Soda is an umbrella project of small libs to speed up development of applications in Scala. Each lib is provided as its own artifact.

It is not another application framework. Frameworks usually tie up application developers to use the (pre-)integrated libs of one version. Instead you can pick an choose from what best fits both, your needs and your taste.

This is a new project. It started with the localization lib i18n.

## The Soda

	i18n : a typesafe localization API - no boilerplate, no magic
    logging : a logging API - Scala wrapper API for SLF4J
