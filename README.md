## About

Soda for Scala is a like soda for drinks. It provides a set of (small) individual libs that speed up development of reald world applications in Scala.

Soda is an umbrella project of small libs to speed up development of applications in Scala. Each lib is provided as its own artifact.

It is not another application framework. Frameworks tend to tie up application developers to use the (pre-)integrated libs of one version. Instead you can pick an choose from what best fits both, your needs and your taste.

This is a new project. It started with the localization lib l10n.

## The Soda

- `soda-l10n` : a typesafe localization API - no boilerplate, no magic
- `soda-logging` : a logging API - Scala wrapper API for SLF4J
- `soda-desktop` : supporting functions for desktop applications
